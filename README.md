This repo contains both the bash and matlab scripts, that were respectively used for preprocessing of diffusion-weighted MRI-scans and graph theory analyses.  
Preprocessing and connectome constructions were done using MRtrix commands (cfr. 3 bash scripts steps 1-3). 
Graph theory analyses were done using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox commands in matlab (cfr. matlab script).
